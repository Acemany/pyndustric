# pyndustric

A compiler from Python to Mindustry's assembly (logic programming language).

To run the tests, simply use the following command:

```sh
$ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
$ pytest
```

## Supported features

Assignment and all operators you know and love:

```python
x = 10
y = x ** 2
y -= 2.5
```

If-elif-else blocks:

```python
if battery_level < 33:
    Screen.clear(255, 0, 0)
elif battery_level < 66:
    Screen.clear(127, 127, 0)
else:
    Screen.clear(0, 255, 0)
```

While and for-loops:

```python
for y in range(80):
    x = 80
    while x > 0:
        x -= 1
```

Built-in functions to print messages and render on-screen ("system calls"), with [f-string] support:

```python
# (optional) Get type-hinting in your editor of choice
from pyndustri import *

var = 42
print(f'The Answer: {var}')

# Draw a tree in a landscape
Screen.clear(80, 150, 255)

Screen.color(50, 200, 50)
Screen.rect(0, 0, 80, 30)

Screen.color(140, 110, 110)
Screen.rect(10, 10, 20, 40)

Screen.color(50, 200, 50)
Screen.poly(20, 50, 20, 100)
```

Custom function definitions (until [this bug is fixed][ip-not-reset], re-importing a new program
using functions may act weird because some critical state can't be properly cleaned up):

```python
def is_prime(n):
    for i in range(2, n):
        r = n % i
        if r == 0:
            return False

    return True

p = is_prime(7)
if p:
    print('7 is prime')
else:
    print('7 is not prime???')
```
